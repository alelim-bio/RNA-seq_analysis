# RNA-seq Analysis

Welcome to the RNA-seq Analysis repository! This repository focuses on the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, providing step-by-step tutorials, code snippets, and resources to guide you through the various stages of the analysis pipeline. Whether you are new to RNA-seq or an experienced researcher, this repository aims to support your work and help you gain insights into gene expression analysis.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. [**Data Preprocessing**](./1_data_preprocessing): This section covers the preprocessing steps involved in RNA-seq data analysis, including quality control, read trimming, and adapter removal. The tutorials and code snippets provided here will guide you through the essential data preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and reliability of your downstream analyses.

2. [**Alignment**](./2_alignment): In this section, you'll find tutorials and code snippets that focus on read alignment to a reference genome or transcriptome. These resources will help you understand and apply alignment algorithms and tools to map the sequenced reads to a suitable reference, allowing you to determine the origin of the reads and their alignment positions.

3. [**Assembly**](./3_assembly): The assembly section provides tutorials and code snippets for transcriptome assembly, which is particularly useful when a reference genome or transcriptome is not available. Here, you'll learn about de novo assembly approaches, assembly evaluation, and subsequent downstream analysis of the assembled transcripts.

4. [**Differential Expression Analysis**](./4_differential_expression): This section covers tutorials and code snippets for differential expression analysis. You'll learn how to identify genes that are differentially expressed between different conditions or experimental groups. This analysis is crucial for understanding gene regulation and identifying genes associated with specific biological processes or diseases.

5. [**Normalization**](./5_normalization): The normalization section includes tutorials and code snippets on the normalization of RNA-seq data. You'll learn about different normalization techniques to ensure accurate comparisons of gene expression levels across samples.

6. [**Visualization**](./6_visualization): In this section, you'll find tutorials and code snippets for visualizing RNA-seq data. Explore different visualization techniques to gain insights into gene expression patterns, identify clusters, and understand the biological significance of differentially expressed genes.

7. [**Functional Analysis**](./7_functional_analysis): The functional analysis section provides tutorials and code snippets for gene ontology (GO) analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, or other functional annotation techniques. Learn how to interpret the biological meaning and implications of differentially expressed genes.

8. [**Integration with Other Omics Data**](./8_integration_omics_data): If applicable, this section includes resources on integrating RNA-seq data with other omics data, such as proteomics or epigenomics data. Discover integrative analysis approaches and uncover insights by combining different data types.

9. [**Best Practices and Tips**](./9_best_practices_tips): The best practices section offers guidance, tips, and considerations for RNA-seq analysis. Learn about experimental design, sample size determination, quality control metrics, and common pitfalls to avoid during the analysis.

## How to Use
